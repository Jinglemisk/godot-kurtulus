## Overview

Build a minimal prototype battle scene with **Kessen 3-style trailing third-person camera**:
- Player unit (commander + 10 soldiers in wedge formation)
- **3D scene with billboarded 2D sprites** (pseudo-3D approach)
- Camera positioned **behind and above** commander, looking down at ~30° angle
- Commander visible in **lower-center of screen** (like Kessen 3)
- WASD movement in world space, camera follows behind
- Q/E rotates camera orbit around commander
- Space to attack (animation cascade)
- Static enemy unit with red tint

### Kessen 3 Camera Reference
The camera should feel like you're following the commander from behind:
```
        [Enemy in distance]
              ↑
    [Squad members trailing]
         [Commander] ← visible in lower screen
              |
           CAMERA (behind/above, looking down ~30°)
```

## Phases

Break the implementation into 7 incremental phases. Each phase produces a testable result.

### Phase 1: 3D Scene Foundation ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Empty battlefield with working camera controls

- [x] Create `scenes/battle/battle_scene.tscn` with Node3D root
- [x] Add WorldEnvironment (procedural sky, ambient light)
- [x] Add DirectionalLight3D (sun with shadows)
- [x] Add Ground (PlaneMesh 100×100 with terrain shader for grass/dirt variation)
- [x] Add CameraPivot (Node3D) + Camera3D child
- [x] Implement Q/E camera orbit in `battle_scene.gd`
- [x] Add UI CanvasLayer with FadeRect
- [x] Add world objects (8 trees, 1 house, 1 oxcart as billboarded Sprite3D)
- [x] Add boundary markers (4 corner posts)
- [x] Add controls HUD overlay

**Test:** Run scene directly, Q/E rotates camera around empty field.

---

### Phase 2: Commander Movement ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Single controllable character with camera follow

- [x] Create `scenes/battle/components/commander.tscn` (CharacterBody3D + Sprite3D)
- [x] Set Sprite3D billboard mode, pixel filtering, load `ataturk-front-rdy.png`
- [x] Implement WASD movement in `commander.gd` relative to camera basis
- [x] Camera pivot follows commander position with lerp smoothing
- [x] Add input actions to `project.godot` (already configured in Phase 1)

**Enhancements Added:**
- [x] **Momentum physics**: Acceleration (20 units/s²), deceleration (15 units/s²), turn penalty (40% speed on direction change)
- [x] **Directional sprites**: Front, back, side, and three-quarter view based on movement direction
- [x] **Boundary constraints**: Commander cannot leave arena (48-unit boundary inside posts)
- [x] **Ground shadow**: Circular shader-based shadow with radial falloff
- [x] **Dust particles**: GPUParticles3D emitted when moving at >30% speed

**Test:** WASD moves commander with momentum, camera follows, Q/E orbits around commander. Sprite changes direction based on movement. Shadow and dust effects visible.

---

### Phase 3: Squad Formation ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal:** 10 soldiers following commander in 5×2 rectangle formation

- [x] Create `scenes/battle/components/soldier.tscn` (CharacterBody3D + Sprite3D)
- [x] Load `infantry/front-rdy.png`, set billboard mode
- [x] Implement formation follow in `soldier.gd` with offset rotation
- [x] Create `scenes/battle/components/unit.tscn` (Node3D container)
- [x] `unit.gd` spawns 10 soldiers with 5×2 rectangle formation:
  ```
  Commander at front (center)
  Row 1: (-3, 0, -2.5), (-1.5, 0, -2.5), (0, 0, -2.5), (1.5, 0, -2.5), (3, 0, -2.5)
  Row 2: (-3, 0, -4.0), (-1.5, 0, -4.0), (0, 0, -4.0), (1.5, 0, -4.0), (3, 0, -4.0)
  ```

**Enhancements Added:**
- [x] **Dust particles**: Soldiers emit dust when moving (14 particles, 0.7s lifetime)
- [x] **Ground shadows**: Circular shader-based shadow per soldier
- [x] **Organic offset**: ±0.3 unit random offset per soldier, changes every 2s
- [x] **Crowding behavior**: Smooth target interpolation - back row lags naturally
  - Row 1: target_lerp_speed 5.0-6.0, follow_speed 0.85-1.0
  - Row 2: target_lerp_speed 4.0-5.0, follow_speed 0.7-0.85
- [x] **Directional sprites**: Front, back, side based on movement direction
- [x] **Idle formation tightening**: Formation scales to 70% when stopped, soldiers cluster closer
- [x] **Look-at-commander when idle**: After 1s stationary, soldiers face toward commander
- [x] **Soft collision avoidance**: Soldiers push apart if closer than 1.2 units (prevents stacking)

**Test:** Move commander, 10 soldiers follow in rectangle. Formation rotates with movement. Back row lags during turns. Stop moving - soldiers cluster and turn to face commander. Sharp turns - soldiers don't stack.

---

### Phase 4: Animations & Combat ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Walk/attack animations with cascade effect

- [x] Commander: Walk animation (3 frames at 8 FPS) for left/right movement
- [x] Commander: Directional idle sprites for forward/back movement
- [x] Commander: Attack animation (3 frames at 10 FPS) on Space key
- [x] Commander: `attack_started` signal for cascade trigger
- [x] Soldier: Directional walk animations (4 directions × 4 frames at 8 FPS)
- [x] Soldier: Directional attack animations (4 directions × 4 frames at 10 FPS)
- [x] `unit.gd`: Attack cascade with 50ms stagger per soldier
- [x] Return to idle sprite when stationary

**Enhancements Added:**
- [x] Attack impact particles (dust burst at attack position)
- [x] Attack cooldown (1 second) to prevent spam

**Test:** WASD shows walk animation (left/right) or directional sprites (forward/back). Space triggers attack cascade through squad with particles and cooldown.

---

### Phase 5: Enemy Unit & Health System ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Add enemy unit with troop-based health, attack range detection, and damage system

**Enemy Unit Setup:**
- [x] Add EnemyUnit (duplicate of unit.tscn, red modulate, rotated 180°, at z=-20)
- [x] Apply red tint via `_apply_tint_recursive()` to all Sprite3D nodes
- [x] Enemy is static (no AI - just visual presence with health)

**Audio Integration:**
- [x] Use `AudioManager.crossfade_to()` for music transition in `_ready()`
- [x] Load `battle-music.mp3` via preload

**Troop-Based Health System:**
- [x] Add `troop_count` property to `unit.gd` (represents total men, e.g., 2000)
- [x] Add `MAX_TROOP_COUNT` constant (2000)
- [x] Add `take_damage(amount: int)` method to `unit.gd`
- [x] Add `troop_count_changed` signal emitted when troops change
- [x] Add `unit_defeated` signal emitted when troop_count reaches 0

**Soldier Visibility (Troop Representation):**
- [x] 10 visible soldiers represent the total troop count proportionally
- [x] Each soldier represents `MAX_TROOP_COUNT / 10` = 200 troops
- [x] As `troop_count` decreases, soldiers disappear (back row first)
- [x] `_update_visible_soldiers()` hides soldiers based on remaining troops
- [x] No death animation yet - soldiers just become invisible

**Attack Range Detection:**
- [x] Add `ATTACK_RANGE` constant to `battle_scene.gd` (12.0 units)
- [x] Check distance between player unit and enemy unit on attack
- [x] Only deal damage when within range
- [x] Print debug messages for hit/miss feedback

**Damage Dealing:**
- [x] Connect commander's `attack_started` signal to `_on_player_attack()`
- [x] `DAMAGE_PER_ATTACK` = 250 (8 attacks to defeat enemy with 2000 troops)
- [x] Connect to enemy's `unit_defeated` signal for victory trigger

**Test:**
1. Move player unit toward enemy (WASD)
2. When close (within 12 units), press Space to attack
3. Console shows "Attack hit! Enemy troops: X/2000"
4. Enemy soldiers disappear as troops decrease (back row first)
5. After 8 attacks, enemy troop_count reaches 0
6. Commander disappears, victory popup appears

---

### Phase 6: Victory Condition & Game Loop ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Victory popup when enemy defeated, restart/menu options

**Victory Detection:**
- [x] In `battle_scene.gd`, connect to enemy unit's `unit_defeated` signal
- [x] When enemy HP reaches 0, trigger victory sequence

**Victory Sequence:**
- [x] Freeze player input (disable movement and attack via `input_enabled` flag)
- [x] Show victory popup after 0.5s delay

**Victory Popup UI:**
- [x] Create `VictoryPopup` (CenterContainer in UI CanvasLayer)
- [x] Panel with gold border (`StyleBoxFlat_victory` with #D4AF37 border)
- [x] "VICTORY!" title in large alfabet98 font (48px, gold)
- [x] "Enemy Defeated" subtitle (24px, cream)
- [x] Two buttons: "Play Again" and "Main Menu"

**Button Actions:**
- [x] "Play Again": Reload battle scene (`get_tree().reload_current_scene()`)
- [x] "Main Menu": Fade out transition to main menu

**Popup Animation:**
- [x] Scale from 0 to 1 with bounce (EASE_OUT, TRANS_BACK, 0.4s)
- [x] Fade in alpha (0.3s)

**Scene Structure Addition:**
```
UI (CanvasLayer)
├── ControlsHUD
├── TransitionLayer
│   └── FadeRect
└── VictoryPopup (CenterContainer, initially hidden)
    └── Panel (StyleBoxFlat with gold border)

                ├── PlayAgainButton
                └── MainMenuButton
```

**Test:** Full victory flow:
1. Main Menu → Campaign → Commander → Battle
2. Move to enemy, attack 8 times (250 damage each, 2000 total HP)
3. Enemy soldiers disappear as HP drops, commander disappears at 0
4. Victory popup scales in with bounce animation
5. "Play Again" restarts battle
6. "Main Menu" fades out and returns to main menu

---

### Phase 6b: Battle UI Enhancements ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal:** HP bars, audio controls, discovery popup, and combat feedback

**HP Bar System:**
- [x] Player HP bar (top-left): Shows "Şemsettin" with green health bar and troop count
- [x] Enemy HP bar (top-right): Shows "Yorgos", appears when within attack range (12 units)
- [x] Ornate styling: Gold borders (#D4AF37), dark sepia background, cream text
- [x] Smooth tween animation on HP changes (0.3s duration)
- [x] Low HP color change: Bar turns bright red at ≤20% health

**Audio Controls:**
- [x] Battle volume reduced by 50% (-6 dB) after crossfade completes
- [x] Mute button (bottom-right): Toggle with 🔊/🔇 emoji icons
- [x] Mute state respected when volume is set after crossfade

- [x] Slide-up animation with fade-in (0.4s)
- [x] Auto-hides after 3 seconds with fade-out

**Floating Damage Numbers:**
- [x] "-250" damage text spawns at enemy position on hit
- [x] Red text (#FF4D4D) with black outline for visibility
- [x] Floats upward 60 pixels over 1 second
- [x] Fades out after 0.3s delay
- [x] Uses 3D-to-2D screen projection for positioning

6. Mute button toggles audio on/off

---

### Phase 7: STITCHING UP
**Goal:** Death animations, basic enemy AI, defeat condition, and combat feedback polish

**Death Animation:**
- [ ] Create death animation sequence for soldiers and commander
- [ ] Retrofit death animation to dying units (currently sprites just disappear)
- [ ] Add death animation trigger when unit health reaches 0
- [ ] Ensure smooth transition from current state to death animation
- [ ] Optional: Add death particles/effects for visual feedback

**Basic Enemy AI:**
- [ ] Enemy remains stationary (no movement/chasing - keeps scope minimal)
- [ ] When player enters attack range (12 units), enemy begins attacking
- [ ] Attack cooldown: 5 seconds between attacks
- [ ] Reuse existing attack cascade animation for enemy attacks
- [ ] Deal `DAMAGE_PER_ATTACK` (250) to player unit on each attack
- [ ] Implementation: Timer-based attack loop in `battle_scene.gd`

var enemy_attack_timer: float = 0.0
var enemy_can_attack: bool = true

func _process(delta: float) -> void:

    _trigger_screen_shake()
    _spawn_damage_number(player_unit.global_position, DAMAGE_PER_ATTACK)
    _update_player_hp_bar()
```

**Screen Shake on Damage:**
- [ ] Add screen shake when player takes damage
- [ ] Shake camera pivot with random offset, decay over 0.3s
- [ ] Intensity proportional to damage or fixed intensity

```gdscript
const SHAKE_INTENSITY: float = 0.3
const SHAKE_DURATION: float = 0.3

var shake_timer: float = 0.0
var original_camera_offset: Vector3

func _trigger_screen_shake() -> void:

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
    # ... existing code ...
    _update_screen_shake(delta)

func _update_screen_shake(delta: float) -> void:
    if shake_timer > 0:
        shake_timer -= delta
        var intensity = SHAKE_INTENSITY * (shake_timer / SHAKE_DURATION)
        var offset = Vector3(
            randf_range(-intensity, intensity),
            randf_range(-intensity, intensity) * 0.5,
            randf_range(-intensity, intensity)
        )
        camera_pivot.position = camera_pivot.position.lerp(
            commander.global_position + offset, 0.5
        )
```

**Defeat Condition (Player Loses):**
- [ ] Connect to player unit's `unit_defeated` signal
- [ ] Show DefeatPopup when player troop_count reaches 0
- [ ] Freeze input on defeat (same as victory)
- [ ] DefeatPopup: "DEFEAT" title, "Your forces have been routed" subtitle
- [ ] Same button options: "Try Again" and "Main Menu"

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
    # ... existing connections ...
    player_unit.unit_defeated.connect(_on_player_defeated)

func _on_player_defeated() -> void:
    input_enabled = false
    await get_tree().create_timer(0.5).timeout
    _show_defeat_popup()
```

**Critical Damage Popup (20% HP Threshold):**
- [ ] Add `unit_critical` signal to `unit.gd`, emitted when HP first drops to ≤20%
- [ ] Track `has_emitted_critical` bool to ensure one-time trigger
- [ ] Show popup at bottom-center: "[Commander Name]'s unit has taken significant damage!"
- [ ] Reuse DiscoveryPopup styling (slide-up, auto-hide after 3s)
- [ ] Works for both player and enemy units

```gdscript
# unit.gd additions
signal unit_critical(commander_name: String)
var has_emitted_critical: bool = false

func take_damage(amount: int) -> void:
    troop_count = maxi(troop_count - amount, 0)

    _update_visible_soldiers()

    # Check critical threshold (20%)
    var hp_ratio = float(troop_count) / float(MAX_TROOP_COUNT)
    if hp_ratio <= 0.2 and not has_emitted_critical and troop_count > 0:
        has_emitted_critical = true
        unit_critical.emit(commander_name)

    if troop_count <= 0:
        unit_defeated.emit()
```

```gdscript
# battle_scene.gd
func _ready() -> void:
    # ... existing code ...
    player_unit.unit_critical.connect(_on_unit_critical)
    enemy_unit.unit_critical.connect(_on_unit_critical)

func _on_unit_critical(commander_name: String) -> void:
    _show_critical_popup(commander_name + "'s unit has taken significant damage!")

func _show_critical_popup(message: String) -> void:
    # Reuse DiscoveryPopup or create CriticalPopup with same styling
    critical_popup_label.text = message
    critical_popup.visible = true
    # Slide-up animation, auto-hide after 3s (same as discovery popup)
```

**Scene Structure Additions:**
```
UI (CanvasLayer)
├── ... existing nodes ...
├── CriticalPopup (CenterContainer - bottom-center, same style as DiscoveryPopup)
│   └── Panel → CriticalLabel
└── DefeatPopup (CenterContainer - center, same style as VictoryPopup)
    └── Panel → Title ("DEFEAT") + Subtitle + Buttons
```

**Test:**
1. Move toward enemy, get within attack range
2. Wait 5 seconds - enemy attacks, player takes 250 damage
3. Screen shakes on player damage
4. Player HP bar updates, floating damage number appears
5. When player HP ≤ 20% (400 troops): "Şemsettin's unit has taken significant damage!" popup
6. When enemy HP ≤ 20%: "Yorgos's unit has taken significant damage!" popup
7. If player HP reaches 0: Defeat popup with "Try Again" / "Main Menu"
8. Death animations play when units are defeated

### Troop-Based Health System Code Reference

**unit.gd additions:**
```gdscript
signal troop_count_changed(current: int, maximum: int)
signal unit_defeated

const MAX_TROOP_COUNT: int = 2000  # Total men in unit
var troop_count: int = MAX_TROOP_COUNT

        soldiers[reverse_index].visible = (reverse_index < soldiers_alive)
```

**battle_scene.gd damage routing:**
```gdscript
const ATTACK_RANGE: float = 12.0  # Units must be this close to hit
const DAMAGE_PER_ATTACK: int = 250  # 8 attacks to defeat (2000 / 250 = 8)

## Assets to Create/Add

1. ~~**assets/sprites/world/grass-ground.png**~~ - Using existing `grass-ground-rdy.png` with terrain shader
2. **assets/battle-music.mp3** - User will provide (placeholder reference in scene)

### Terrain Shader (`ground_terrain.gdshader`)
Uses procedural noise to blend between original dirt texture and green-tinted grass:
- `grass_tint`: Green color applied to grass areas (default: 0.4, 0.6, 0.3)
- `noise_scale`: Size of grass/dirt patches (default: 2.0)
- `grass_threshold`: Balance of grass vs dirt (default: 0.5)
- `blend_softness`: Smoothness of transitions (default: 0.1)

### Circular Shadow Shader (`circular_shadow.gdshader`)
Spatial shader for commander ground shadow with radial falloff:
- `shadow_color`: Color with alpha (default: black at 0.4 alpha)
- `falloff`: Controls edge softness (default: 1.5, range 0.1-3.0)
- Render mode: `unshaded, cull_disabled, depth_draw_never, shadows_disabled`
- Discards pixels outside unit circle for clean circular shape

### Dust Particles (GPUParticles3D)
Commander emits dust when moving at >30% max speed:
- Amount: 12 particles
- Lifetime: 0.6 seconds
- Direction: Upward with gravity pulling down
- Color: Tan/brown (0.6, 0.5, 0.35) with transparency
- Mesh: Small boxes (0.15 units)

## Core Logic (3D Implementation)

### Movement (commander.gd) - Implemented
```gdscript
# Constants for momentum physics
const MAX_SPEED: float = 10.0
const ACCELERATION: float = 20.0       # Units/sec² - reaches max in 0.5s
const DECELERATION: float = 15.0       # Units/sec² - stops in ~0.67s
const TURN_PENALTY: float = 0.4        # Speed multiplier when changing direction
const TURN_THRESHOLD: float = 0.7      # Dot product threshold for "turning"

# Get WASD input as Vector2
var input_dir = Input.get_vector("move_left", "move_right", "move_forward", "move_backward")

# Convert to 3D direction relative to camera facing
var camera_basis = camera_pivot.global_transform.basis
var desired_dir = (camera_basis.z * input_dir.y + camera_basis.x * input_dir.x)
desired_dir.y = 0

        current_speed *= TURN_PENALTY  # Slow down when turning
    current_direction = desired_dir
    current_speed = minf(current_speed + ACCELERATION * delta, MAX_SPEED)
    update_sprite_facing(input_dir)  # Change sprite based on direction
else:

### 8-Direction Sprite Mapping
| Input | Direction | Sprite | Mirrored |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| W | forward | back | no |
| S | backward | front | no |
| A | left | side-left | no |
| D | right | side-left | yes |
| W+A | forward-left | 3/4 back | yes |
| W+D | forward-right | 3/4 back | no |
| S+A | backward-left | 3/4 front | no |
| S+D | backward-right | 3/4 front | yes |

### Camera (battle_scene.gd) - Implemented
```gdscript
@onready var camera_pivot: Node3D = $CameraPivot
@onready var commander: CharacterBody3D = $Commander

const CAMERA_ROTATION_SPEED = 2.0  # rad/sec
const CAMERA_FOLLOW_SPEED = 8.0

func _ready() -> void:
    commander.camera_pivot = camera_pivot  # Wire camera reference

func _process(delta):
    # Smooth follow commander position
    var target_pos = commander.global_position
    camera_pivot.global_position = camera_pivot.global_position.lerp(
        target_pos, delta * CAMERA_FOLLOW_SPEED
    )

    # Rotate camera orbit with Q/E
    if Input.is_action_pressed("camera_left"):
        camera_pivot.rotate_y(CAMERA_ROTATION_SPEED * delta)
    if Input.is_action_pressed("camera_right"):
        camera_pivot.rotate_y(-CAMERA_ROTATION_SPEED * delta)
```

### Formation (soldier.gd)
```gdscript
# Each soldier has a fixed offset (wedge shape behind commander)
var formation_offset: Vector3  # e.g., Vector3(-2, 0, 3) = left-back

func _process(delta):
    # Rotate offset based on commander's facing direction
    var rotated_offset = formation_offset.rotated(Vector3.UP, commander.rotation.y)
    var target_pos = commander.global_position + rotated_offset

    # Smooth follow
    global_position = global_position.lerp(target_pos, delta * FOLLOW_SPEED)
```

### Sprite Billboard Setup
All character sprites use Sprite3D with billboard mode:
```gdscript
# In _ready() or set in editor
sprite_3d.billboard = BaseMaterial3D.BILLBOARD_ENABLED
sprite_3d.texture_filter = BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST  # Pixel art
sprite_3d.no_depth_test = false  # Proper depth sorting
```                                                                 
                                                                                                      
### Attack Cascade (unit.gd)
